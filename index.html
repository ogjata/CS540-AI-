    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p class="intro-paragraph">This site will help one discover the importance and usage of Skip Lists, a 
        data structure that offers efficient sorted sequence maintenance. 
        Developed by William Pugh in 1989, Skip Lists provide O(n) 
        time complexity for search, insertion, and deletion. 
        It has layers of linked lists and a a little bit of randomization;
        Skip Lists have the balance between simplicity and efficiency, 
        which makes them a great choice for various applications.</p>

    <h2>Main Features</h2>
    <ul class="feature-list">
        <li><strong>Layered Structure:</strong> Skip Lists contain multiple 
            layers of linked lists, where each layer may contain a subset of elements 
            from the layer below to improve the efficiency of the search.</li>
        <li><strong>Randomization:</strong> This algorithm uses randomization when 
            constructing Skip Lists so it contributes to their structure 
            and predictable performance.</li>
        <li><strong>Efficient Search:</strong> Skip Lists have a very efficient search operation, 
            making them a valuable data structure for quickly locating and retrieving elements explained 
            below in the algorithm steps.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Uses of Skip Lists</h2>
    <ul id="uses-list">
        <li>Database indexing</li>
        <li>Priority queues</li>
        <li>File systems</li>
        <li>and more...</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="algorithm-title">Algorithm Steps for Search</h2>
    <p class="algorithm-info">PLEASE REFER TO THE IMAGE BELOW</p>
    <ol class="algorithm-steps">
        <li>For example, we are going ahead to start the search for number 45. 
            We will Start at the top-left or the beginning of ten.</li>
        <li>We proceed to the next horizontal node 10 is pointing two and 
            check whether that number is less than or equal to the search number, 45.</li>
        <li>It is in fact smaller, so we continue and reach 57 which is greater. 
            Therefore, we stay at the current position and go down a level to continue our search.</li>
        <li>We continue iterating using that same algorithm until we reach 45 if there is 45.</li>
    </ol>
